# Guess The Number
My second project written in C#

When you start playing you have the option to select a number between `1` and `100`
The computer will also pick a number between `1` and `100` and it will tell you if your number is higher or lower than the computer's number.
The game will keep going until you select a number that matches the one that the computer chose

If you submit an input that doesn't match these options you will be met with an `error`.
